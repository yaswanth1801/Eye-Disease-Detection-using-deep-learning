 Eye Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect eye diseases from retinal images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on labeled datasets and integrates with a Flask-based web interface to provide real-time predictions for users.

 Features

 Dataset preprocessing and splitting (train/test)
 Model training using deep learning
 Flask backend for model integration
 HTML frontend for user interaction
 End-to-end pipeline from data to deployment
